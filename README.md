# Arkose, a GPT-3 enhanced document editor

Arkose is a no-frills document editor that talks with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model API.  

Reasons to use Arkose:
- **AI-assisted writing** - Writer's block?  Boilerplate?  Press a key to get AI help.
- **Dirt cheap** - Bring your own GPT-3 API key.  This is 50 to 2000x cheaper than commercial AI document editors.
- **Private and lightweight** - Arkose is a client.  Your documents are transmitted directly to GPT-3 without middle men.
- **Write in Markdown** - Formatting, headings, bullets, code, etc.
- **Portable** - Export your documents to other formats (markdown, html, docx, json)
